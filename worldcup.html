	<p> The prize fund for the competition has been increased to a staggering USD 2.5 million, making it the single richest reward pool for any chess competition in the world. <br><br>

The 10-year anniversary of the knock-out chess extravaganza, which takes place every two years, will be marked in Baku, Azerbaijan, from July 30 to August 24, 2023. The first round of matches will all be played on July 30, while the opening ceremony is scheduled for July 29.<br><br>

146 of the 206 participants in the World Cup in Baku in 2023 and 71 of the 103 participants in the Women's World Cup have already been announced. At the end of the Zonal competitions and following the deadline for eligible federations to submit their nominations, which is June 15â€“30, the field will be finalized.<br><br>

Magnus Carlsen, currently ranked first in the world, leads the list once more. Despite being a strong proponent of knockout competitions, Magnus still has a few championships left to add to his remarkable resume, and this is surely a big incentive for the former World Champion. His best performance to date came in Sochi 2021, where he dazzled the crowd with some stunning matches (including his two triumphs over Fedoseev), but was eliminated by eventual champion Jan-Krzysztof Duda in the semifinals.<br><br>

The winner of the Candidates Tournament twice and the runner-up in the last two World Championship matches, Ian Nepomniachtchi, will be the second seed. "Nepo" decided to forego Sochi 2021 in order to concentrate on his preparation for the match in Dubai after reaching just the fourth round of his most recent participation, at Khanty-Mansiysk 2019, when he was eliminated by Yu Yangyi. <br><br>

Next on the list are Teimur Radjabov and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov, followed by Fabiano Caruana, Anish Giri, Wesley So, and Maxime Vachier Lagrave. In his final appearance, Khanty-Mansiysk 2019, Radjabov won the World Cup. He will undoubtedly be a very strong candidate for the title thanks to the added incentive of playing on his home turf.<br><br>

The pack of up-and-coming young prodigies, which also includes Nodirbek Abdusattorov (18 years old, 14th on the starting list), Rameshbabu Praggnanandhaa (17 years old, 25th seed), and Vincent Keymer (18 years old, 26th), is led by Indian teenager Gukesh Dommaraju, who is ranked as the tenth seed.<br><br>

In the Women's World Cup, Humpy Koneru of India will be the top seed. Despite losing some rating points over the past year, Koneru is still ranked second in the world, just one point behind the current World Champion Ju Wenjun and ahead of the semi-retired Hou Yifan.<br><br>

Undoubtedly one of the competition's highlights will be Ju Wenjun's participation in the Women's World Cup. She is scheduled to defend her championship against her countrywoman Lei Tingjie from July 5 to 25 in the weeks leading up to the World Cup, though it was unclear if she would accept the challenge. Whether Ju arrives in Baku as the current World Champion or soon after losing her title is still to be determined, but in either case, and despite the anticipated exhaustion following the contest, she will undoubtedly be one of the top candidates for victory.<br><br>

The remaining three top seeds for the competition are Aleksandra Goryachkina, Kateryna Lagno, and reigning Women's World Cup champion Alexandra Kosteniuk. Tan Zhongyi, Mariya Muzychuk, Harika Dronavalli, Nana Dzagnidze, and Anna Muzychuk are the individuals who come after them. Gunay Mammadzada, 22, will be the top-rated local player.<br><br>

One of FIDE's premier tournaments, the World Cup has recently established itself as one of the most popular fixtures on the chess calendar. This reflects FIDE's efforts to broaden the field of competitors by increasing the variety of qualification routes and the number of represented nations (estimated at 50 for the 2023 edition), while sharply reducing the number of wild cards. <br><br>

Since the top three finishers in the competition move on to the very competitive Candidates Tournament, the World Cup represents for many players their first and only chance to compete for the World Championship title. As a result, there will be one more berth available than in the previous edition, Sochi 2021, where only the winners would qualify. This competition will now be even more exciting as the winner of the match for third or fourth place would also receive the coveted invitation for the Candidates.<br><br> </p>
