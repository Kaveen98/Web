	<p> Hikaru Nakamura defeated tournament leader Fabiano Caruana in the decisive game of the last round to win his first Norway Chess championship. <br><br>
	
	Finansparken in Stavanger, Norway, hosted the 11th iteration of this famous competition, a 10-player round-robin that featured premier GMs, from May 30 to June 9. Every round was a traditional game with a win worth three points and a loss worth zero. In the event of a tie, the players engaged in a game of Armageddon, where the winner received 112 points and the loser received just 1, with a tie favoring Black. <br><br>
		
	Fabiano Caruana defeated Magnus Carlsen in the opening classical game, took the initiative, and maintained the top spot through Round 9. The winner played Hikaru Nakamura in the championship match, as tournament fate would have it. Hikaru had a chance to take the championship away from Fabiano by winning the classical game with the white pieces when trailing Caruana by 2.5 points.  <br><br>
		
	The opposition used a well-known Two Knight Defense line that has recently been tested in numerous games. Black received adequate compensation for a sacrificed pawn, but Caruana's first original move (17...f5? as opposed to the tried-and-true 17...Nb4) proved to be the game-changing error as Hikaru easily gained another pawn. Caruana must have misunderstood the move order, as in some variations, f7-f5 is quite advantageous for Black, the victor stated in his post-game interview. As soon as possible, Nakamura stopped the opponent's initiative and used his extra pieces to win the game. <br><br>
		
	Hikaru received 750,000 NOK in payment and 27.19 FIDE Circuit points. Second place went to Fabiano Caruana (16.5/27), while third place went to 17-year-old Gukesh Dommaraju (14.5/27), who gave a really strong performance. Magnus Carlsen, the five-time and reigning champion of Norway in chess, came in sixth place without taking any traditional games.  <br><br>
